# Face-eyes-smile_detection

📸 Real-Time Face, Eye & Smile Detection using OpenCV

This project uses OpenCV’s Haar Cascade Classifiers to detect faces, eyes, and smiles in real-time through your webcam.
It demonstrates computer vision basics such as image processing, object detection, and real-time video frame analysis.

🧩 Features

Detects faces, eyes, and smiles in real-time.

Uses Haar Cascade Classifiers from OpenCV.

Highlights each detected feature with bounding boxes.

Displays dynamic labels (e.g., “Eyes Detected”, “Smile Detected”).

Runs on any system with a webcam.

⚙️ Technologies Used

🐍 Python 

👁️ OpenCV (cv2)

💻 Haarcascade Models
(haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml, haarcascade_eye.xml, haarcascade_smile.xml)

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/opencv-face-eye-smile-detection.git
cd opencv-face-eye-smile-detection


Install dependencies:

pip install opencv-python


Run the program:

python detect_faces_eyes_smile.py


Press q to quit the webcam window.

🖼️ Demo

(Attach a short GIF or screenshot here showing your webcam detecting your face and smile — this boosts engagement!)

💡 Future Improvements

Add Mediapipe or DNN face detection for better accuracy.

Create a simple GUI using Tkinter or PyQt.

Log detection data for analysis.
